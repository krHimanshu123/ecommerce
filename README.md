# React + Vite Template

This repository provides a professional and minimal setup to kickstart React development using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a set of recommended ESLint rules. It is designed for rapid development, optimal performance, and easy customization for both small and large React projects.

## Plugin Options

This template supports two official Vite plugins for React:

| Plugin | Description | Fast Refresh Engine | Documentation |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) | Babel-based | Babel | [Read More](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) |
| [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) | SWC-based | SWC | [Read More](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) |

Choose the plugin that best fits your project's needs. SWC offers faster build times, while Babel provides broader ecosystem support.

## ESLint

This template includes a recommended ESLint configuration. To run lint checks:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

Customize `.eslintrc.js` to fit your team's coding standards.
